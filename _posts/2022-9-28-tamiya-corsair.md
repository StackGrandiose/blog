<p>This kit was purchased for only around 20 dollars, which was a very good deal. Opening up the box there are 3 sprues (2 plastic & 1 clear), instructions, and a decal sheet. The clear parts were clear and parts were molded with pretty good detail. According to scalemates, the kit was released in 2000.</p>

<h3>Cockpit</h3>
<p>Like most airplane models, the first assembly step is the cockpit. The design of putting the cockpit together was very nice. The center stick was fragile and broke off. This was carefully glued back on. After all the parts were assembled, everything was painted with Model Masters FS34087 with the airbrush. The rest of the details were painted on with a paintbrush with Tamiya Semi-Gloss Black + Red + Yellow. The sides of the cockpit was painted similarly.</p>

<h3>Body Assembly</h3>
The assembly of the fuselage came together very nicely with all the parts fitted almost perfectly. holes were drilled with a small drill bit for the rockets to be glued in later. The wings were connected with the fuselage which was very easy. Once finished, it becomes very hard to see where any parts meet to be glued due to the design being very descrete about it. 

<h3>Painting</h3>
The whole body was painted with Mr.Surfacer 1000 + some regular lacquer. It dried pretty fast, but this is most likely due to Mr.Color Leveling Thinner not being used which has a retarder that slows down drying time. I had never used this surfacer before but the result was really amazing. It did a very good job and served as a very good base for the full coat. To protect the painted wheel wells from the surfacer and future layers pieces of foam were cut and placed in.

The instructions called for AS-8 Navy Blue (US Navy) but I found X-3 Royal Blue worked just fine. I don't believe I thinned the paint enough to be passed through the airbrush efficiently. This lead to a splattered look which was coarse.

<h3>Extra Notes</h3>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
If I had to redo this kit, I think the main thing that I would do differently is the body color. I believe the paint was not thinned down properly enough and if thinned would result in a lot smoother of an appearance. I would have also airbrushed the yellow on the nose instead of painting it with a brush.
