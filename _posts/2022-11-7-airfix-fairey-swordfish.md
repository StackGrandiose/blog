<p>The Fairey Swordfish is a torpedo bomber that served for the Royal Airforce for the duration of the Second World War. Even though being obsolete, it still saw use as a torpedo bomber and later on used as an anti-submarine plane. Building this Fairey Swordfish was an excerise in careful rigging of all the bracing. The final model also was painted with a camoflague color scheme, which was also a technique challenge. </p>

<h3>Parts</h3>
<p> I bought this kit for only around 25 dollars. For a 1/72 scale plane, this seems to be an appropriate price. This box art depicts the Fairey Swordfish Mk.I with the "No.825 Naval Air Squadron, Fleed Air Arm, HMS Glorious, 1939" color scheme, with its striking yellow stripes. In the box, there are 4 sprues marked A-E, with the E sprue being clear plastic. The texture on the parts were varied, and was a decent representation of the material on the real aircraft. A good example of this are the wings, which are molded to look like fabric. </p>
