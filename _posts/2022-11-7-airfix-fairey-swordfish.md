<p>The Fairey Swordfish is a torpedo bomber that served for the Royal Airforce for the duration of the Second World War. Even though being obsolete, it still saw use as a torpedo bomber and later on used as an anti-submarine plane. Building this Fairey Swordfish was an excerise in careful rigging of all the bracing. The final model also was painted with a camoflague color scheme, which was also a technique challenge. </p>

<h3>Parts</h3>
<p> I bought this kit for only around 25 dollars. For a 1/72 scale plane, this seems to be an appropriate price. This box art depicts the Fairey Swordfish Mk.I with the "No.825 Naval Air Squadron, Fleed Air Arm, HMS Glorious, 1939" color scheme, with its striking yellow stripes. In the box, there are 4 sprues marked A-E (with the E sprue being clear plastic) and a decal sheet. The texture on the parts were varied, and was a decent representation of the material on the real aircraft. A good example of this are the wings, which are molded to look like fabric. </p>

<h3>Paint</h3>
<p>For this model, I chose the "B" Color scheme, which is a blue and green camoflague pattern. One challenge was the paint colors in the instructions simply beling numbers. These numbers represent humbrol paint codes. Due to me not being able to obtain humbrol colors and tamiya colors being more available in my area, I needed to decode the paint colors. I would either look up the humbrol color and go by its paint name or look at a online conversian chart for a close match. The paints I used were:</p>

- Cockpit Green: XF-71 <br>
- Medium Blue: XF-18 <br>
- Olive Drab (JGSDF): XF-74 <br>
- Black: XF-1 <br>

<p> The instructions called for one shade on the top wing and a seperate shade on the bottom. However, I just used the same color for both. It seemed like too much work to try and either buy new colors or mix a different shade. I dont believe it changed the quality of the outcome.
